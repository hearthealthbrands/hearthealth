                <h2>Week 1: Focus on Addition, Not Subtraction</h2>
                <p>Your first week is not about deprivation. It's about adding powerful, LDL-lowering foods into your diet. This mental shift is crucial for avoiding the "Taste Fatigue" that trips so many people up.</p>
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Add <strong>Soluble Fiber</strong> to your daily routine.</h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> Soluble fiber acts like a sponge. As it moves through your digestive tract, it binds to cholesterol and pulls it out of your body before it can enter your bloodstream.</p>
                
                <h2>Week 2: Master the Fats</h2>
                <p>Fat isn't the enemy—the <em>type</em> of fat is what matters. This week, we'll focus on replacing "bad" fats with heart-healthy "good" fats.</p>
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Incorporate <strong>Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturated Fats.</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> These healthy fats help reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol circulating in your blood and can even help raise your "good" HDL cholesterol.</p>
                
                <h2>Week 3: The Power of Plants</h2>
                <p>You don't need to become a vegetarian, but incorporating more plant-based foods is one of the most effective strategies for lowering LDL.</p>
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Introduce <strong>Plant Sterols/Stanols and Soy Protein.</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> Plant Sterols & Stanols are structurally similar to cholesterol. They block your body from absorbing the cholesterol in your food. Soy protein has also been shown to have a modest but meaningful effect on lowering LDL.</p>
                
                <h2>Week 4: Build Your Go-To Meals & Reflect</h2>
                <p>You've spent three weeks building powerful new habits. Now it’s time to put them together and create a sustainable routine that works for <em>you</em>.</p>
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Identify 2-3 "go-to" meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> The biggest reason people fail is "Information Overload" and "Time Constraints." By having a small number of trusted, easy meals, you eliminate daily decision-making and stress.</p>
