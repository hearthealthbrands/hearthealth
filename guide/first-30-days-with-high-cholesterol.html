                <h2>Week 1: Focus on Addition, Not Subtraction</h2>
                <p>Your first week is not about deprivation. It's about adding powerful, LDL-lowering foods into your diet. This mental shift is crucial for avoiding the "Taste Fatigue" that trips so many people up.</p>
                
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Add <strong>Soluble Fiber</strong> to your daily routine.</h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> Soluble fiber acts like a sponge. As it moves through your digestive tract, it binds to cholesterol and pulls it out of your body before it can enter your bloodstream.</p>
                
                <h3>How to Do It (The Easy Way):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breakfast Power-Up:</strong> Start your day with a bowl of oatmeal or a handful of barley. These are packed with a type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, a proven LDL-buster.</li>
                    <li><strong>Snack Smart:</strong> Swap chips or cookies for an apple, a pear, or a handful of edamame. These are easy, portable, and require no prep.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dinner Boost:</strong> Add a side of Brussels sprouts or asparagus to your evening meal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Limit (Not Eliminate):</h3>
                <p>This week, just be mindful of <strong>Saturated Fats.</strong> These are typically found in red meat, butter, and full-fat dairy. They signal your liver to produce more LDL cholesterol. A simple swap is to replace red meat with chicken or fish once this week.</p>
                
                <h2>Week 2: Master the Fats</h2>
                <p>Fat isn't the enemy—the <em>type</em> of fat is what matters. This week, we'll focus on replacing "bad" fats with heart-healthy "good" fats.</p>
                
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Incorporate <strong>Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturated Fats.</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> These healthy fats help reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol circulating in your blood and can even help raise your "good" HDL cholesterol.</p>

                <h3>How to Do It (The Easy Way):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Avocado Hack:</strong> Add a quarter of an avocado to your toast or salad.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook Smarter:</strong> Switch from using butter to using olive oil for cooking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nutrient-Dense Snacking:</strong> A small handful of almonds or walnuts makes for a powerful, cholesterol-lowering snack.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What to Avoid (The Real Culprit):</h3>
                <p>This week, your focus is on eliminating <strong>Trans Fats</strong> (often listed as "partially hydrogenated oils" on ingredient labels). They hide in commercially baked goods, fried foods, and some margarines.</p>
                
                <h2>Week 3: The Power of Plants</h2>
                <p>You don't need to become a vegetarian, but incorporating more plant-based foods is one of the most effective strategies for lowering LDL.</p>
                
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Introduce <strong>Plant Sterols/Stanols and Soy Protein.</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> Plant Sterols & Stanols are structurally similar to cholesterol. They block your body from absorbing the cholesterol in your food. Soy protein has also been shown to have a modest but meaningful effect on lowering LDL.</p>

                <h3>How to Do It (The Easy Way):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fortified Foods:</strong> Look for products like certain orange juices or margarines that are fortified with plant sterols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meatless Monday (The Simple Version):</strong> Try swapping ground beef for tofu or lentils in a chili or pasta sauce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy Edamame:</strong> A cup of steamed, salted edamame is a fantastic, protein-rich snack.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Week 4: Build Your Go-To Meals & Reflect</h2>
                <p>You've spent three weeks building powerful new habits. Now it’s time to put them together and create a sustainable routine that works for <em>you</em>.</p>
                
                <h3>Your Key Goal: Identify 2-3 "go-to" meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</h3>
                <p><strong>Why it Works:</strong> The biggest reason people fail is "Information Overload" and "Time Constraints." By having a small number of trusted, easy meals, you eliminate daily decision-making and stress.</p>
                
                <h3>Your 30-Day Reflection:</h3>
                <p>Look back at the last month. You've taken incredible steps to protect your heart. This is not about perfection; it’s about progress. You are now equipped with the foundational knowledge and habits to manage your cholesterol and take control of your health for the long term.</p>
